# Lore

**Lore** is an open-source, local-first AI coworker that connects to your email and meeting notes, builds a long-lived knowledge graph, and uses that context to help you get real work done — privately, on your machine.

Unlike generic AI assistants that start cold every session, Lore accumulates context over time. It knows your projects, your people, your decisions, and your commitments — and compounds that knowledge to make you genuinely more effective.

## ✨ Features

- **Persistent Memory** — Lore builds and maintains a knowledge graph from your emails and meeting notes. Context accumulates over time rather than starting from scratch every session.
- **Meeting Prep** — Get a crisp brief before any meeting, pulling past decisions, open questions, and relevant threads automatically.
- **Email Drafting** — Draft replies grounded in your history, commitments, and relationships.
- **Docs & Decks** — Generate PDFs, summaries, and project updates using your real ongoing context.
- **Background Agents** — Set up recurring tasks that run automatically — morning briefings, email drafts, knowledge graph updates, and more.
- **Voice Memos** — Record voice notes that are automatically transcribed and captured into your knowledge graph.
- **Bring Your Own Model** — Works with local models (Ollama, LM Studio) or hosted models via your own API key.
- **MCP Tool Support** — Extend Lore with external tools via Model Context Protocol (Slack, GitHub, Linear, Exa, ElevenLabs, and more).
- **Local-First** — All your data lives on your machine as plain Markdown. No cloud lock-in, no hidden formats. Inspect, edit, or delete anything at any time.
